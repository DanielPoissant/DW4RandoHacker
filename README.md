# Dragon Warrior 4 RandoHacker

## Features
- Can adjust XP gains from 50% to 500%, and randomize those XP gains.
- Can adjust gold gains from 50% to 200%, and randomize that as well.
- Can randomize monsters
- Can change which hero plays in which chapter.  This can also be randomized.  For example, you can have Cristo participate in Chapter 1 instead of his usual Chapter 2.
- Can also change when each hero joins in Chapter 5.  This can also be randomized.  For example, Alena and Brey can join in Endor instead of Nara and Mara.
- Can award XP for Chapter 2 tournament monsters.
- Can change purchase costs of the shop to 1GP or 25000GP, as well as the purchase cost of the tunnel to 1GP in Chapter 3.
- Can speed up battles, which is highly recommended!
- Can rename the other 7 heroes, as well as Healie, Orin, etc.!
- Can set up a "solo hero challenge", details of which are below.

### Solo Hero Challenge
- The character you select is the only character you get to play with the entire game.
- If an NPC joins you, it will change to the character you selected.  (see above)
- The character gains HP at twice the rate as usual, to give you chance... especially against Necrosaro.
- To complete Chapter 4 successfully, the Magic Key is found in the first treasure chest of the Aktemto Mine.  (it usually has Mystic Acorns in it)
- You have an opportunity for the solo hero to equip everything, but it's not required.  However, all Zenithian equipment will be equippable by all solo heroes regardless so you can get through the Zenithian Tower and Castle.

## To Do/Wishlist
- Randomize monster patterns.  Maybe.
- Figure out the Fairy Water so you can kill metal monsters with it like you can in the Japanese version.
- Randomize stat gains.
- Have a second variant of the "solo hero challenge" with the characters being NOT sharing the same HP/MP/inventory/etc.
