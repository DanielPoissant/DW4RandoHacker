# Dragon Warrior 4 RandoHacker

## Features
- An opportunity to adjust XP gains from 50% to 500%.
- An opportunity to set up a "solo hero challenge", details of which are below.

### Solo Hero Challenge
- The character you select is the only character you get to play with the entire game.
- If an NPC joins you, it will change to the character you selected.  (see above)
- The character gains HP at twice the rate as usual, to give you chance... especially against Necrosaro.
- To speed things up, the shop is only one piece of gold, and the tunnel is one piece of gold in Chapter 3.
- To complete Chapter 4 successfully, the Magic Key is found in the first treasure chest of the Aktemto Mine.  (it usually has Mystic Acorns in it)
- The solo hero can equip everything, again, so you have a chance to win.  (This change may be reversed in the future, but the hero still will be able to equip Zenethian equipment so you can enter the tower and castle)
